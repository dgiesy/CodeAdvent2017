Work for the Advent Of Code exercises for 2017
http://adventofcode.com/2017

Advent Of Code is an open source series of small programming puzzles.
As days pass I will upload my solutions to previous days.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!
These will be (hopefully) working solutions to the problems. If you want to work these for yourself from scratch go directly to the URL above.
